        Hello! Welcome to my site! I hope you like it!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am <b>Kan Onn Kit</b> (Ryan Kan), a Singaporean. I am known as <code>PhotonicGluon</code> online. I am a
        programmer by trade and a hobbyist writer and music composer on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied at Nanyang Junior College (NYJC). My education there allowed me to foster teamwork and collaboration
        skills, as well as develop a good work ethic. I am often described as a level-headed person when making
        decisions. I consider the facts and evidence of the matter instead of relying (solely) on emotion and feeling. I
        am sociable and love to work in a team. Challenges are appealing to me, as they allow me to showcase my
        problem-solving skillset and come up with a solution.
