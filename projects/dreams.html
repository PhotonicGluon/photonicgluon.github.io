    <em>Dreams</em> is an album exploring the thoughts that appear in the subconscious and the hidden truths revealed
    within.
</p>
<p>
    Since finishing <em>7125</em>, I've been learning how to use <a href="https://www.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a>.
    I'm happy to say that this has led to a significant improvement in the music quality and allowed me to create more
    emotional tracks along the way.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to <em>7125</em>, secrets are hidden within these tracks. Similar to how literature may have subtextual
    meaning to the words written on the page, I feel that music too should have a double meaning in what they represent.
    Acute listeners can spot these double meanings and decipher these tunes.
</p>
<p>
    The final album is primarily available on <a href="https://melodicgluon.bandcamp.com/album/dreams">Bandcamp</a>, but
    it is also available on... <!-- Todo: add other places -->
</p>
<h2>Tracks</h2>
<p>
    The music tracks of <em>Dreams</em> can be split into two halves. The first half can be loosely called "Positive",
    as tracks in this half are mainly bright and cheerful. The second half centres around the theme "Negative", with
    darker tracks centred more on horror and terror.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sleep</em> imitates the way that we gradually fall asleep. It was purposefully composed to be simple and
            lullaby-like, with as minimal changes to the core melody as possible while still creating a nice-sounding
            track.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sleep</em> uses only a few instruments to create its core tune. The guitar and bass are the stars of the
            track, with their use heavily inspired by that of <em>Awakening</em>. The core melody is the 'cool-down'
            melody of the second half of <em>Awakening</em>, allowing it to subtly reference Sleep in its melody. The
            piano serves as the quiet backer for the melody, until right at the end, where it imitates the ending of
            <em>Awakening</em> to form a sense of completeness by the end of the album.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the third track that was composed, the samples used are very similar to what was used in
            <em>Awakening</em>, the second track to be composed. I'm quite pleased with how <em>Sleep</em> turned out,
            although I could foresee future improvements that I could make to it when I feel like it.

        </p>
        <p>
            The theme of nostalgia and carefree joy is the core of the melody of <em>Memories</em>. It aims to remind
            the listener of a simpler time when things were straightforward, and when we didn't have to care about so
            many things in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The carefree melody of <em>Memories</em> is complemented by the bright strings and choir, along with the
            leading guitar and bass. The bright chords create a cheerful atmosphere and drive the melody forward.
            Although the melody is simple, the layered instrumentation of the complementing instruments gradually makes
            <em>Memories</em> into an orchestra of joy. Also, the main themes of <em>Dreams</em> are emphasised
            repeatedly in Memories, with the core leitmotif of <em>Dreams</em> played on a loop at the end of the track
            to emphasise that the memories we see in our dreams are in our past now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being the last track to be composed, <em>Memories</em> acts as a very nice 'farewell' track to this project,
            with the best melodies from all other tracks incorporated within <em>Memories</em>. I feel that this track
            does my time with <em>Dreams</em> justice, and gives a sense of closure to <em>Dreams</em> as a project.

            Entering a deeper state of the subconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the last formal track of the first half of <em>Dreams</em>, this track is literally a gateway into the
            next half of the album. I wanted to explore the feeling of digging deeper into a deeper state of the
            subconscious, as we fall into a deeper state of sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Gateway</em> can be considered an appropriate follow-up to <em>Memories</em> (although it was composed
            first), as similar techniques of composition were used in <em>Gateway</em>, as in <em>Memories</em>.
            Specifically, a repeated chorus is constantly punctuated in the track. Also, similar instrumentation to
            <em>Memories</em> makes it have a similar soundscape to it. But, as a melodic send-off for the first half,
            it references parts of the melody in <em>Sleep</em> and <em>Memories</em> and has more reverb than the
            former tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Gateway</em> was number six to be composed. As I had just finished composing both <em>Dark</em> and
            <em>Inferno</em>, I challenged myself to compose a track that had an air of grandiose and epicness, similar
            to<em>Awakening</em>, instead of creating a simple and bland track. The final revision of <em>Gateway</em>
            was my answer to this challenge, and I am proud of what I put out.

            Something feels off...
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Dark</em> imitates the feeling when the mind starts to wander off to a (literally and figuratively)
            darker place. The feeling that something bad is about to occur lingers heavily within the track, as the
            melody progressively gets darker and darker as time progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Dark</em> acts as a bridge between the first and second halves of the album. The core melody of the
            track signals impending terror and horror, while not yet introducing too serious of a concern. The ending
            sting serves as a hint of what is to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Dark</em> was the fifth to be completed. The melody is nothing too remarkable, with my aim just to make
            a song to bridge the two halves of the album together. Still, I believe I did a decent job of linking the
            two halves together.

            You can't escape that easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Nightmare</em> is, at its core, about the terror of nightmares. The feeling that things aren't right and
            that you can't escape the terror is the central theme of the piece. As time progresses, the melody increases
            in tempo to simulate the feeling of an increasing heart rate, and the unnerving atmosphere set by the song
            keeps getting worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Nightmare</em> is the most technically challenging piece of the album. The inception for this song began
            right at the start of the project, but it was only recently that I was able to come up with the sounds
            needed for the feel and atmosphere that I wanted to create. Making the backing "boom" sound just right took
            the most time, followed by the rapidly adjusting static sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Nightmare</em> was composed right after <em>Gateway</em>. I originally wanted the start of
            <em>Nightmare</em> to be the backing for <em>Gateway</em>, but eventually, I felt that the "boom" was more
            suited for a horror-based track instead. And thus <em>Nightmare</em> was born.
        </p>
        <p>
            The full experience of <em>Nightmare</em> is best experienced with high-quality headphones. I am very proud
            of <em>Nightmare</em>, so much so that the <a href="https://youtu.be/hHR1V49jYXU">bonus piece for
            <em>Dreams</em></a> uses the backing of <em>Nightmare</em>.

            Why does everything not make sense?
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Inferno</em> asks the question about troubling dreams when one is almost awake. Dreamscapes stop making
            sense, and it feels as though reality is burning around you. The unnerving feeling from <em>Nightmares</em>
            is gone, but it is replaced with a sense of urgency and a new form of terror &mdash; escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Inferno</em> was my first experience in creating music with synthesizers. Using simple kicks, I created
            a simple tune that just got stuck in my mind. After some messing about, the core of <em>Inferno</em> was
            born. The added flames in the soundscape were meant to re-emphasise the name of the song (i.e.,
            <em>Inferno</em>), and their increasing volume highlights how close to danger one is.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Inferno</em> was the fourth to be completed, but I had to repeatedly update the mixing of it to better
            fit in with the rest of the tracks. Being one of the two 'Electronic' tracks of the album (the other being
            <em>Nightmare</em>), and being the first of the two to be created, it posed an interesting challenge and
            experiment for me to see what kind of music I could make.

        <p>
            What if something that you knew all your life was hidden away in the subconscious?
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary soundscape for <em>Truth</em> is by the sea, by a departing ship. The song aims to recreate the
            sombre feelings of a goodbye, to someone you will never see again. Of course, there's a deeper message
            behind the tunes, which avid listeners can decipher. Regardless, <em>Truth</em> reflects a different kind of
            horror than the previous two tracks &mdash; the horror of realisation about something so fundamental that
            you
            can't take it back.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Truth</em> was primarily composed as an experimental piece, with a focus more on the story being told by
            the soundscape rather than actual music. Waves crashing against the shore are a constant undertone to the
            sombre melody played by the strings and piano. Heavily modified chimes/tubular bells act as the ship's bell
            and evoke a sense of sadness when coupled with the ship's horn that is being played by the tuba.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike all the other tracks, and being the first, <em>Truth</em> was originally composed in <a
                href="https://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a>. This was before I got FL Studio, so some of the tunes were
            lifted from the original project files from there. Consequently, as the first track to be fully composed,
            <em>Truth</em> set the direction for the types of music that appear in <em>Dreams</em>.

        <p>
            With the truth in hand, it's time to awaken.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, <em>Awakening</em> could have been split into two tracks, since the two halves are quite different
            from each other. But splitting <em>Awakening</em> in two would not do justice to the feeling that I want to
            convey with this final track.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first half of <em>Awakening</em> is a sort of melancholy feeling of hope when emerging from slumber. It
            is sad for the nice dreams to end, and the sanctity of sleep to disappear. The knowledge gained from
            <em>Truth</em>also dampens the mood, especially if one is still denying that fundamental fact. Nevertheless,
            facts are unchangeable, and we must accept them as truth. The second half of <em>Awakening</em> gives hope;
            some knowledge that everything will be fine. It lifts the melody out of the negativity brought by the second
            half of the album, and back into the realm of positivity, albeit slightly affected by the revelations in
            <em>Truth</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Awakening</em> aims to be the most epic track in the album, especially in the second half. A healthy mix
            of strings, guitars, pianos, choir, and SFX is used to create the atmosphere of hope and melody in
            <em>Awakening</em>. The second half of the track, in particular, layers together many different instruments
            to properly bring joy back to the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Awakening</em> was conceived very early on in the album's planning stages. I knew from the start that
            <em>Awakening</em> had to be the last song on the album, and so it was composed right after I experimented
            with <em>Truth</em>. Being the second song that I made in FL Studio, I am immensely proud of how the track
            sounds.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Overall, I am happy with how <em>Dreams</em> turned out. I managed to create 8 tracks that I am happy to call my
    own, and to evoke feelings through the music within the album.
