title: n-Gram Language Model
---

Some Python code that implements a rudimentary n-Gram language model from scratch.

This code was originally meant to form part of a larger project, where a hexadecimal value was to be encoded into words 
by using the n-Gram model and using RegEx to filter the desired words. However, this turned out to be too cumbersome to 
implement, and I removed it from that project. However, it was still fun to dive into the process of creating a very 
simple language model, so I moved the code here into this project.
