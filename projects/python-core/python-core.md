A beginner's Python course in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

I largely adapted the content of the course from [Sololearn's Python Core](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1073)
course, but the exercises, discussions, and assignments were my own creation. I made this course in 2020 just for fun.
It came into use in 2022 when I was training new computer science club members in Python. The course should be
sufficient for one to gain a background in Python,

Originally, the course was published under my other GitHub account, [Oxyhydride](https://github.com/Oxyhydride).
However, I have transferred the ownership of the repository to PhotonicGluon in 2023. Minor content edits were then made
to fix some minor issues.
