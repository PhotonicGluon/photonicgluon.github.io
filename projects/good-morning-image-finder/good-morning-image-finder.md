This is an application that helps find "Good Morning" images automatically.

One of my earliest projects that experimented with web scraping using Selenium. This is also one of a few projects that
can only be properly set up on Linux, due to the fact that it relies on cron jobs to process things.

This project also allowed me to experiment with email sending capabilities using the SMTP protocol in Python.
