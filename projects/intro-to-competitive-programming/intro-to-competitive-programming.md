Jupyter Notebooks for teaching Competitive Programming simply.

I largely adapted the content of the course from Steven and Felix Halim's excellent book "Competitive Programming 3". 
I made this course in 2022 when I was training computer science club members in competitive programming. The course
should be sufficient for one to learn the fundamentals of competitive programming, although more advanced topics like
graph theory and mathematics are not taught here.

Originally, the course was published under my other GitHub account, [Oxyhydride](https://github.com/Oxyhydride).
However, I have transferred the ownership of the repository to PhotonicGluon in 2023. Minor content edits were then made
to fix some issues.
