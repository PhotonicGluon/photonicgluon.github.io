*AudiTranscribe* is an open-source music transcription application.

# Features

*AudiTranscribe* was built to assist you in transcribing music pieces.

- Convert supported audio files into spectrograms for easier transcription.
- Play notes alongside the music piece to get a "feel" of what notes are being played by clicking on the appropriate row
  on the spectrogram.
- Get a sense of how the notes are arranged in the song.

# History / Why make *AudiTranscribe*?

I started work on *AudiTranscribe* way back in November 2021. I used Flask and my web-design skills to make a
rudimentary version of *AudiTranscribe*. The old version of *AudiTranscribe* which was written in Python can still be
found [here](https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/AudiTranscribe-Python).

At some point, I decided that making a web-application to perform essentially local computations was a daft idea, and so
shifted to Java to work on the next iteration of *AudiTranscribe*. This was formally started on 20 February 2022, and
continues to this day.

I made *AudiTranscribe* because I found transcribing music by ear hard. Tiny details in music pieces may be left out,
and it takes practice to properly transcribe notes from a song. *AudiTranscribe* was created to ease this process and
allow the average person to find out the notes of their favourite songs. Also, professional music transcription services
cost *a lot*, especially if you plan to use the transcription service a few times over a year. In that case, the cost of
these services (which range from $40 to $120) are not worth it. *AudiTranscribe* is an open-Source and free alternative.
