The above screenshot shows the main page of the Quaestiones website once questions are added.

- You can add as many questions as you like.
- You can customise the "score" for every question. (Or simply remove the scoring system entirely.)
- You can show the number of solves for each question. (Or not. It is up to you.)

After clicking on a question, here's what you would see:

Other than those two, administrators are able to easily add and modify questions on the go via a "Manage Questions"
page:

# History

This is the second web-based project that I tried out. I was heavily inspired by the [*Advent of Code
2020*](https://adventofcode.com/2020) by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), and wanted to make a similar (if not heavily
adapted) version of his project. *Quaestiones* (which means "questions" in latin) was the result of that decision.
