A program that helps convert a video into a transcript with timestamps.

# History / Why make *Video to Captions*?

I made *Video to Captions* to help cut down time on creating captions for videos which have a fixed transcript. Creating
captions for videos is sometimes a long and laborious process, so I've made this program to help relieve some pain from
the video creator.

*Video to Captions* was also an experiment in using lowerquality's [Gentle](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle), a "
robust yet lenient forced-aligner built on Kaldi" that helps "[align] speech with text". This involves the program
communicating with Gentle through CLI within Python, which was an intresting experience to program.
