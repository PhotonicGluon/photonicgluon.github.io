<!-- Introduction -->
<div>
    <p>
        A close confidant and I had an unusual arrangement. We would send each other locked (i.e., encrypted) files
        containing our deepest secrets, knowing that we trusted each other enough not to let anything spill out.
        Recently we
        agreed to take this one step further, by putting these files online.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is what I've done.
    </p>

    <p>
        Releasing this on my 20th birthday definitely has some meaning to it. These are things that I'm afraid to say
        out
        loud in the past decade, during my teens. Now I leave the teenage years behind as I become a young adult. It
        reminds
        me of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" -- there is an unspoken urge to just say out these things, but I know
        that I can't. I mustn't.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope that, someday, these secrets wouldn't be too hard to share. But for now they must remain locked. In
        multiple
        layers of truth.

<!-- Password Explanation -->
<div style="padding-top:25px">
    <p>
        Passwords for the layers follow the following format.

        <li>The hint may be a cipher.</li>
        <li>The only valid characters are the uppercase letters A to Z, and the dash (<code>-</code>).</li>
        <li>Each password consists of one or more words, separated by a dash.
            <ul>
                <li>For example, <code>CAT</code>, <code>HELLO-WORLD</code>, <code>CAT-AND-DOGS</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There are no leading or trailing spaces for each password.</li>
    </ul>

    The hint for <b>Layer 1</b> is as follows.
