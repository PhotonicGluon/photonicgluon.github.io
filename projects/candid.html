<!-- Introduction -->
<p>
    A close confidant and I had an unusual arrangement. We would send each other locked (i.e., encrypted) files
    containing our deepest secrets, knowing that we trusted each other enough not to let anything spill out. Recently we
    agreed to take this one step further, by putting these files online.
</p>

<p>
    This is what I've done.
</p>

<p>
    Releasing this on my 20th birthday definitely has some meaning to it. These are things that I'm afraid to say out
    loud in the past decade, during my teens. Now I leave the teenage years behind as I become a young adult. It reminds
    me of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" -- there is an unspoken urge to just say out these things, but I know
    that I can't. I mustn't.
</p>

<p>
    I hope that, someday, these secrets wouldn't be too hard to share. But for now they must remain locked. In multiple
    layers of truth.
